# Cake Store Web App
This is a simple web application that implements some basic functionality for a bakery's online store. It is based on a Razor tutorial I took online from here: https://www.learnrazorpages.com/razor-pages/tutorial/bakery7

## Concepts I've learned through

 - Razor syntax.
 - Entity Framework.
 - Migrations.
 - Seeding databases.
 - Scaffolding CRUD pages.
 - Managing cookies.
 - Sending emails.
 - Managing forms.

## I visited the tutorial site, and the source code is available to download, and it's almost the same than yours!
it is supposed that, if you're going to follow a tutorial, you do it with a goal in mind: TO LEARN.

I typed from scratch all the code following the instructions provided in the tutorial because I want to learn the concepts. It's really easy to download the project already finished, modify some words and publishing it. But that is the same as making a fool of myself. 

I don't intend to publish the ultimate application. I publish a project that helped me to learn concepts and tools that will allow to me working on similar projects in the future.

Obvously, a tutorial won't make me an expert, but you can be sure that I've understood every aspect of this project. Although I need to go deeper on some technologies (like SASS and Entity Framework) I got a general idea about how it works.
